    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Mercy. I am Geologist, an author and now a web designer. I
      have interest in data analysis and specialize in website and application
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      {" "}
      I am a jovial, fun loving person. Alot of people whom I have worked
      withdescribe me as a solution oriented person and I agree because I am
      always looking for solutions to problems. When I am not working, I love
      spending time with my family. I love listening to music and spending time
      in nature which is where I get most inspirations from. Over the past few
      weeks I have been in a web development boot camp and I have listed below
      some of the skills that I look forward to acquiring at the end of the
      program.
