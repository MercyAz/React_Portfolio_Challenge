# React-Portfolio-Challenge

# Description 
This project is mainly about recreating my already existing portfolio, using react.

React is flexible and efficient Javascript library which is used to create an interactive web page.  It contains a navigation tool using React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

The portfolio has my name, links to my GitHub profile, LinkedIn page and Email address.

While doing this project, I also utilized grid and flex box in the styling which made the website more responsive. There are two deployed projects and since the website is still undergoing development, more projects will be added as soon as they get completed.
